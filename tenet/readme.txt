Tenet Container Library

This library is intended to provide a small selection of the most useful
kinds of container. A 'container' is an abstract data type whose main
purpose is to hold a collection of data items specifically organised in
a way most suitable to the way the program uses the data. Each Tenet
container is designed to be as general-purpose and easy to use as
possible, whilst working efficiently in what is anticipated to be
typical usage.

Please see the accompanying documentation for more information about
this software.
