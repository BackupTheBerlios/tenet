Tenet (Ada Container Library)

Copyright (C) 2003 Nicholas James Roberts (South Croydon, Surrey, UK).

Part of the Tenet Container Library. See the bottom (end) of this file
for important legal information.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tenet Container Library

This library is intended to provide a small selection of the most useful
kinds of container. A 'container' is an abstract data type whose main
purpose is to hold a collection of data items specifically organised in
a way most suitable to the way the program uses the data. Each Tenet
container is designed to be as general-purpose and easy to use as
possible, whilst working efficiently in what is anticipated to be
typical usage.

Please see the accompanying documentation for more information about
this software.

Every library unit, or group of closely related units, should have a
separate TDL file which contains a chapter describing the purpose,
design, and significant implementation details of the unit or units.

In addition, there should also be a separate TDL containing a chapter of
user documentation, describing how to use the unit or units.

Currently, the most up-to-date copy of Tenet is being held at the
BerliOS development site:

   https://developer.berlios.de/projects/tenet

A complete record of the development of Tenet is held on the CVS server
there. Instructions for joining a project and accessing the CVS server
are published on the site.
