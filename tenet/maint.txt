Tenet (Ada Container Library)

Programmer & Maintainer Notes

Copyright (C) 2003 Nicholas James Roberts (South Croydon, Surrey, UK).

Part of the Tenet Container Library. See the bottom (end) of this file
for important legal information.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction [NJR]

This file is for all the documentation associated with maintaining the
Tenet library. Everything here should be in addition to the other
documentation (and should try not to repeat what is in other the other
documentation).

Maintainers! Please be diligent in putting as much useful information --
short of waffle -- in this file as you can, to help yourself (when your
memory of what you're doing now has run out), and to help others who are
and will be maintaining Tenet. Thanks.

Please obey the convention in this file of noting who has written what.
If you add a new section, put your initials in square brackets after the
title. If you add a paragraph, add your initials in square brackets at
the end, as in [NJR]. If you alter a paragraph, add your initials
preceded by a comma, as in [NJR,XYZ].

The style of writing in this file is informal; it is a set of notes from
programmers to programmers. The style of writing in the other
documentation should be kept formal, please (but not stiff).

Currently, the most up-to-date copy of Tenet is being held at the
BerliOS development site:

   https://developer.berlios.de/projects/tenet

A complete record of the development of Tenet is held on the CVS server
there. Instructions for joining a project and accessing the CVS server
are published on the site.

Package: Debugging [NJR]

This package provides a few simple facilities supporting the debugging
of Ada programs. I'll write more documentation on this ASAP. [NJR]


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory "test" [NJR]

This directory contains all the test programs needed to thoroughly test
the whole Tenet library. The "njr1*.*" files are a framework for
automating a test-run on my humble 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
File "manifest.txt" [NJR]

This file contains a list of the names, one per line, of the files which
comprise the source code of Tenet as a legal entity (a work under
copyright). If you add files to Tenet which should be protected, please
add their names to this list. Do not include any of the trivial files
which have no need to be protected by the terms of the GPL. Remember
that you can never remove files from any published version of this list!

If you distribute Tenet, you must include (or make available) at least
all the files listed in "manifest.txt".
